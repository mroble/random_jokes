# random_jokes
A simple Ruby program to practice my Ruby skills, as well as keep my daughter amused! This program uses the Array#sample method to generate one random joke at a time.

All jokes were taken from *National Geographic Kids Just Joking : 300 Hilarious Jokes, Tricky Tongue-Twisters, and Ridiculous Riddles* for purely educational purposes.
